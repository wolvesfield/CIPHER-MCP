## Mission Briefing

Transform product requirements into production-ready implementation. This mission takes you from concept through deployment-ready code with full testing and documentation.

## Required Inputs

1. **PRD/Requirements** (required) - Product requirements document
2. **Architecture Guidelines** (optional) - Technical constraints or patterns
3. **Design System** (optional) - UI/UX guidelines or mockups

## Mission Phases

### Phase 1: Strategic Analysis (30-45 minutes) - IMMEDIATE ACTION

**Lead**: @strategist  
**Objective**: Transform requirements into actionable user stories

**COORDINATOR PROTOCOL**:
1. **UPDATE project-plan.md** with Phase 1 tasks:
   ```markdown
   ## Mission: BUILD [Feature Name]
   
   ### Phase 1: Strategic Analysis (In Progress)
   - [ ] Create detailed user stories in INVEST format (assigned to @strategist)

### Phase 5: Quality Assurance (1 hour)

**Lead**: @tester  
**Support**: @developer  
**Objective**: Ensure production quality

```bash
@tester Validate the implementation:

- [ ] Deployment ready

## Common Variations

### Quick Build (2-4 hours)
- Skip formal design phase
- Minimal documentation
- Focus on core functionality

### Enterprise Build (8-16 hours)
- Extended architecture phase
- Formal design review
- Comprehensive documentation
- Load testing included

### Prototype Build (1-2 hours)
- Proof of concept only
- Minimal testing
- Basic documentation

## Coordination Notes

- Maintain project-plan.md throughout mission
- Each phase requires explicit completion confirmation
- Blockers immediately escalated to coordinator
- Frequent progress.md updates (after each deliverable and fix attempt - including failures)

**File Operations** (Sprint 2 Architecture + Sprint 6 Enforcement):
- Coordinator automatically parses and executes structured JSON output from specialists
- File operations now have ~99.9% reliability with zero manual verification required
- Specialists provide `file_operations` array → Coordinator executes Write/Edit tools automatically
- See migration guide: `project/field-manual/migration-guides/file-persistence-v2.md`
- See examples: `project/examples/file-operations/` (single, multiple, edit, mixed patterns)

**⚠️ Sprint 6 Enforcement Protocol** (After EACH delegation with file operations):
1. **Validate Response**: Check for `file_operations` JSON (not completion claims)
2. **Execute Operations**: Use coordinator's Write/Edit tools with JSON parameters
3. **Verify Files**: `ls -la [path]` and `head -n 5 [path]` for content
4. **Log to progress.md**: "✅ Files verified: [names] - [timestamp]"
5. **Mark Complete**: Only after steps 1-4 pass

**Red Flags in Specialist Responses** (DO NOT mark complete if present):
- "file created successfully" without JSON
- "wrote file to..." without file_operations array
- Any completion claim without structured output

## Mission Debrief Protocol

Upon completion:
1. Update progress.md with comprehensive learnings and root cause analyses
2. Document ALL fix attempts (including failed ones) with rationale and outcomes
3. Add prevention strategies for all issues encountered
4. Note time variations from estimates
5. Capture reusable patterns and improvement suggestions
6. Ensure issue history includes complete attempt logs for future reference

## Post-Mission Cleanup Decision

After completing this mission, decide on cleanup approach based on project status:

### ✅ Milestone Transition (Every 2-4 weeks)
**When**: This mission completes a major project milestone, but more work remains.

**Actions** (30-60 min):
1. Extract lessons to `lessons/[category]/` from progress.md
2. Archive current handoff-notes.md to `archives/handoffs/milestone-X/`
3. Clean agent-context.md (retain essentials, archive historical details)
4. Create fresh handoff-notes.md for next milestone
5. Update project-plan.md with next milestone tasks

**See**: `templates/cleanup-checklist.md` Section A for detailed steps

### 🎯 Project Completion (Mission accomplished!)
**When**: All project objectives achieved, ready for new mission.

**Actions** (1-2 hours):
1. Extract ALL lessons from entire progress.md to `lessons/`
2. Create mission archive in `archives/missions/mission-[name]-YYYY-MM-DD/`
3. Update CLAUDE.md with system-level learnings
4. Archive all tracking files (project-plan.md, progress.md, etc.)
5. Prepare fresh start for next mission

**See**: `templates/cleanup-checklist.md` Section B for detailed steps

### 🔄 Continue Active Work (No cleanup needed)
**When**: Mission complete but continuing active development in same phase.

**Actions**: Update progress.md and project-plan.md, continue working.
