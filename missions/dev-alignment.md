# Mission: Dev-Alignment 🎯
## Existing Project Understanding & Setup

### Mission Type
**Project Analysis** - Understanding and aligning with existing codebases

### Estimated Duration
45-60 minutes

### Required Assets
- Existing codebase
- Ideation documents (if available)
- Project documentation
- User context/vision

---

## Mission Briefing

This mission aligns AGENT-11 with an existing project by:
1. Analyzing current codebase structure
2. Understanding project goals and context
3. Reviewing or creating ideation documents
4. Establishing progress tracking
5. Optimizing CLAUDE.md for the specific project

### Prerequisites
- AGENT-11 deployed to existing project
- Access to codebase
- Project context (from docs or user)

---

## Execution Protocol

### Phase 0: MCP Assessment (3 min)
```bash
/coord "Discovering available MCPs in the project..."
```

**Agent Actions:**
- @coordinator checks for available MCPs with grep "mcp__"
- Identifies which MCPs are configured
- Maps MCPs to current architecture:
  - If Supabase used: Check for mcp__supabase
  - If tests exist: Check for mcp__playwright
  - For any libraries: Note mcp__context7 availability
- Documents MCP availability in analysis

### Phase 1: Codebase Analysis (15 min)
```bash
/coord "Starting project alignment. Let me analyze your existing codebase..."
```

**Agent Actions:**
- @architect performs codebase audit:
  - Technology stack identification
  - Architecture pattern analysis
  - Dependencies review
  - Code quality assessment
  - Test coverage check
- @developer identifies:
  - Core functionality
  - Integration points
  - Development patterns
  - Build/deployment setup

**Analysis Output:**
```markdown

### Phase 2: Context Discovery (15 min)
```bash
/coord "Now let's understand your project's mission. Do you have ideation documents, or shall we discover the context together?"
```

**Two Paths:**

#### Path A: Existing Ideation Documents
**Agent Actions:**
- @strategist reviews provided documents
- Extracts key objectives
- Identifies gaps in documentation
- Creates consolidated vision

#### Path B: Context Discovery Session
**Agent Actions:**
- @strategist conducts discovery:
  ```
  Questions:
  1. What problem does this project solve?
  2. Who are the target users?
  3. What are the core features?
  4. What's the current status?
  5. What are the immediate goals?
  6. What are the pain points?
  7. What's the vision for success?
  ```
- @documenter creates ideation.md from responses

2. [Objective 2]
3. [Objective 3]

## Progress Tracking Protocol

### project-plan.md (FORWARD-LOOKING)
**What we're PLANNING to do**:
- Update when: Mission start, phase start, task completion
- Task lists with checkboxes [ ] → [x]
- Milestones, success metrics, risk assessment

### progress.md (BACKWARD-LOOKING CHANGELOG)
**What we DID and what we LEARNED**:
- Update when: After EACH deliverable, after EACH fix attempt, when issue resolved
- Log ALL fix attempts (including failures) - not just final solutions
- Root cause analysis for all issues
- Prevention strategies and lessons learned
- **CRITICAL**: Failed attempts teach us what doesn't work and why

### Update After:
1. **Each Deliverable**: Log to progress.md with description
2. **Each Change**: Record in progress.md with rationale
3. **Issue Discovery**: Create issue entry in progress.md immediately
4. **EACH Fix Attempt**: Log attempt, rationale, result, learning (even if it fails)
5. **Issue Resolution**: Add root cause analysis and prevention strategy
6. **Task Completion**: Mark [x] in project-plan.md
7. **Phase End**: Update both files with results and lessons

## Post-Mission Cleanup Decision

After completing this mission, decide on cleanup approach based on project status:

### ✅ Milestone Transition (Every 2-4 weeks)
**When**: This mission completes a major project milestone, but more work remains.

**Actions** (30-60 min):
1. Extract lessons to `lessons/[category]/` from progress.md
2. Archive current handoff-notes.md to `archives/handoffs/milestone-X/`
3. Clean agent-context.md (retain essentials, archive historical details)
4. Create fresh handoff-notes.md for next milestone
5. Update project-plan.md with next milestone tasks

**See**: `templates/cleanup-checklist.md` Section A for detailed steps

### 🎯 Project Completion (Mission accomplished!)
**When**: All project objectives achieved, ready for new mission.

**Actions** (1-2 hours):
1. Extract ALL lessons from entire progress.md to `lessons/`
2. Create mission archive in `archives/missions/mission-[name]-YYYY-MM-DD/`
3. Update CLAUDE.md with system-level learnings
4. Archive all tracking files (project-plan.md, progress.md, etc.)
5. Prepare fresh start for next mission

**See**: `templates/cleanup-checklist.md` Section B for detailed steps

### 🔄 Continue Active Work (No cleanup needed)
**When**: Mission complete but continuing active development in same phase.

**Actions**: Update progress.md and project-plan.md, continue working.
