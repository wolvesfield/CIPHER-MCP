## MVP Principles

### Include
- Core value proposition
- One main user flow
- Basic authentication
- Simple analytics
- Feedback mechanism

### Exclude
- Nice-to-have features

2. Collect feedback actively
3. Fix only critical bugs
4. Plan iteration based on data
5. Decide: pivot, persevere, or scale

## Coordination Notes

- Daily standups during build
- Rapid decision making
- Document assumptions
- Track velocity
- Celebrate launch!

**File Operations** (Sprint 2 Architecture + Sprint 6 Enforcement):
- Coordinator automatically parses and executes structured JSON output from specialists
- File operations now have ~99.9% reliability with zero manual verification required
- Specialists provide `file_operations` array → Coordinator executes Write/Edit tools automatically
- See migration guide: `project/field-manual/migration-guides/file-persistence-v2.md`
- See examples: `project/examples/file-operations/` (single, multiple, edit, mixed patterns)

**⚠️ Sprint 6 Enforcement Protocol** (After EACH delegation with file operations):
1. **Validate Response**: Check for `file_operations` JSON (not completion claims)
2. **Execute Operations**: Use coordinator's Write/Edit tools with JSON parameters
3. **Verify Files**: `ls -la [path]` and `head -n 5 [path]` for content
4. **Log to progress.md**: "✅ Files verified: [names] - [timestamp]"
5. **Mark Complete**: Only after steps 1-4 pass

## Post-Mission Cleanup Decision

After completing this mission, decide on cleanup approach based on project status:

### ✅ Milestone Transition (Every 2-4 weeks)
**When**: This mission completes a major project milestone, but more work remains.

**Actions** (30-60 min):
1. Extract lessons to `lessons/[category]/` from progress.md
2. Archive current handoff-notes.md to `archives/handoffs/milestone-X/`
3. Clean agent-context.md (retain essentials, archive historical details)
4. Create fresh handoff-notes.md for next milestone
5. Update project-plan.md with next milestone tasks

**See**: `templates/cleanup-checklist.md` Section A for detailed steps

### 🎯 Project Completion (Mission accomplished!)
**When**: All project objectives achieved, ready for new mission.

**Actions** (1-2 hours):
1. Extract ALL lessons from entire progress.md to `lessons/`
2. Create mission archive in `archives/missions/mission-[name]-YYYY-MM-DD/`
3. Update CLAUDE.md with system-level learnings
4. Archive all tracking files (project-plan.md, progress.md, etc.)
5. Prepare fresh start for next mission

**See**: `templates/cleanup-checklist.md` Section B for detailed steps

### 🔄 Continue Active Work (No cleanup needed)
**When**: Mission complete but continuing active development in same phase.

**Actions**: Update progress.md and project-plan.md, continue working.
