5. Estimate development complexity for each component
6. Suggest optimizations or alternatives where needed
```

**Deliverables**:
- Feasibility assessment
- Risk identification
- Technology validation
- Implementation considerations

### Phase 4: Documentation Generation (30-45 minutes)

**Lead**: @documenter  
**Support**: @architect  
**Objective**: Create comprehensive architecture documentation

```bash
@documenter Using the architecture-template.md and all gathered information:
1. Generate complete architecture.md document
2. Create all necessary diagrams (ASCII or descriptions)
3. Document all architectural decisions with rationale
4. Include development and deployment guidelines
5. Add monitoring and operations sections
6. Ensure all sections are complete and consistent
7. Add glossary and references
```

**Deliverables**:
- Complete architecture.md document
- All supporting diagrams
- Decision log
- Operations guide

### Phase 5: Final Review (15-30 minutes)

**Lead**: @architect  
**Support**: @developer, @strategist  
**Objective**: Ensure documentation accuracy and completeness

```bash
@architect Perform final review:
1. Verify technical accuracy of all sections
2. Ensure consistency across the document
3. Validate that all requirements are addressed
4. Check that diagrams match descriptions
5. Confirm architectural decisions are justified
6. Approve for team use
```
